# AI-based-Search-and-Rescue-Robot

The SAR (Search and rescue) robotâ€™s primary aim is to traverse through an unknown environment and Search for victims struck during a catastrophe. This Robot will maneuver in the environment using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) as it assists the bot to map the environment using SLAM (simultaneous Localization and Mapping) as it does the reconnaissance and site evaluation. Raspberry PI V2 camera is used to locate the victim. The NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform powers the Robot, which autonomously moves and locates victims in situations where human rescue operation could be perilous to the rescue team.
