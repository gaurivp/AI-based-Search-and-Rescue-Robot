# AI-based Search and Rescue Robot

The SAR (Search and rescue) robotâ€™s primary aim is to traverse through an unknown environment and Search for victims struck during a catastrophe. This Robot will maneuver in the environment using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) as it assists the bot to map the environment using SLAM (simultaneous Localization and Mapping) as it does the reconnaissance and site evaluation. Raspberry PI V2 camera is used to locate the victim. The NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform powers the Robot, which autonomously moves and locates victims in situations where human rescue operation could be perilous to the rescue team.

The main reason for death occurs due to the delay in the rescue of the victims during outcome of a disaster, as it is impossible to find the victims. The rescue operation cannot endanger lives of rescue team in adverse situation. In this type of situation where victim rescue must be attempted and not risking the other lives for that in that kind of situation, it is technology advancement can be the saviour. The existing search and rescue robot is not completely automated. It needs human interference to maneuver the robot to locate the victims struck in the catastrophe. This method will be time consuming and will be limited to known environment. So this can lead to the delay in the operation. So it is to develop an AI based autonomous robot that act as an saviour to the victims, as the robot is designed and developed to take decision in planning its course of path by avoiding obstacles, analysing the environment and to search the area to find victims using localization algorithm, by implementing shortest path algorithm to take them to the safe zone.
